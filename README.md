# StampI18n

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/karpiu/stamp-i18n.png)](http://travis-ci.org/karpiu/stamp-i18n)

Little plugin for 'stamp' gem. It uses I18n locale files to customize date and time stamps.

**This only works with versions of `stamp` up to 0.4. Check out [stamp-l10n](https://github.com/TandaHQ/stamp-l10n) for more recent versions of `stamp`.**

## Installation

Add this lines to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'stamp', '0.4.0' # does not work with newer versions
    gem 'stamp-i18n'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Before using

This gem uses i18n translation mechnism, which means before using it, first we need to add proper translation files to locales folder and then setup i18n configuration. Example YML files used for testing is written in few various languages and are located in ./locale folder. Look for more examples here: [https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale)

## Usage

Same as in [http://rubydoc.info/gems/stamp](http://rubydoc.info/gems/stamp) but instead of using method 'stamp' like this:

    date = Date.new(2011, 6, 9)
    date.stamp("March 1, 1999")         #=> "June  9, 2011"
   
we are using new method 'localize_stamp' like this:

    date = Date.new(2011, 6, 9)
    date.localize_stamp("March 1, 1999")         #=> "junio  9, 2011" if default locale is :de
    date.localize_stamp("March 1, 1999")         #=> "czerwiec  9, 2011" if default locale is :pl
    
Note that we are still using english names in examples passed to stamp methods.

You can also optionally pass options (as hash) to new method that will eventually be passed to underling 'I18n.translate' (therefore lookup this methods options for complete reference). For example if you want to use other locale than your default you can use:

    date = Date.new(2011, 6, 9)
    date.localize_stamp("March 1, 1999", :locale => 'en')       #=> "June  9, 2011"
    date.localize_stamp("March 1, 1999", :locale => 'de')       #=> "Juni  9, 2011"
    date.localize_stamp("March 1, 1999", :locale => 'pl')       #=> "Czerwiec 9, 2011"
